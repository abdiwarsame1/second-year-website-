	<p>Psychological Therapy</p>
	<p>A Doctor, Psychologist or other qualified health professionals would talk with the person about their symptoms and concerns, and discuss with them ways of managing them.</p>

    <p>Medication</p>
	<p>Some people are helped by taking medication for a while; others may need it on an ongoing basis. The doctor should explain the benefits and possible side-effects of medication before it is prescribed.</p>
	<p>Medical research shows that many mental illnesses are associated with changes in our brain chemistry. Medications help the brain to restore its usual chemical balance, so that the symptoms are reduced or even eliminated.</p>
	
	<p>Community support programs</p>
	<p>Support programs are especially important for people with recurrent symptoms or who have a psychiatric disability.</p>
	<p>This support may include information, accommodation, help with finding suitable work, training and education, psychosocial rehabilitation and mutual support groups.</p>
